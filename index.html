    Hi! I'm Poornima 🌸, and I have a deep passion for exploring various creative pursuits that fuel both my mind and soul. When I'm not tackling complex problems or working on my tech skills, you’ll often find me in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and enjoying the art of cooking 🍳. I love problem-solving, whether it’s through tech, puzzles, or finding unique solutions in everyday life. Beyond that, I enjoy expressing my creativity through makeup and fashion 💄👗. I believe dressing well is a form of self-expression, and it gives me the confidence to take on any challenge. Balancing these passions allows me to stay inspired, energized, and ready to embrace all that life has to offer. ✨
